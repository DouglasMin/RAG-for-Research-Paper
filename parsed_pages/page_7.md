MEDITERRANEAN MARKET COMMENTARY
===============================

 market enters its usual fourth quarter slowdown period, that  
a number of tankers are to become open for spot business  
from around 5 October onwards. While vessel waiting and  
discharge lengthy delays at Alexandria, Egypt, mean some
