SUB\-SAHARAN AFRICA MARKET COMMENTARY
=====================================

 pect of any deliveries into that market, Naftal had sent its  
first 300t bitutainer volume to Nouakchott for the Maurita\-  
nian market in late\-August, also from Arzew. Naftal, which  
is in the process of expanding its fleet of bitutainers build by  
an Algerian firm, has also been supplying small\-scale bitut\-  
ainer volumes into Niger from its depots in southern Algeria.

 Nigeria
=======

   
Nigerian bitumen stocks remained at high levels after a  
number of cargo deliveries into its terminals during Septem\-  
ber at a time of weak demand amid continued and intensive  
rainy season conditions.

   
The latest data released by the country's Petroleum  
Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) showed stocks  
of the product stood on 30 September at 31,106,384 litres  
(31,707t), down slightly from a peak of 31,906,036 litres  
(32,523t) on 22 September but still 26pc up from the 1 Sep\-  
tember level of 24,729,625 litres (25,208t).

   
The 5,076 dwt Jane Asphalt arrived at the Abidjan ter\-  
minal in Ivory Coast to load its next cargo for delivery into  
Gradient Energy's Warri terminal in Nigeria's Delta State.  
All previous cargo shipments on board the tanker into the  
Gradient terminal during 2021 have been made from Spanish  
export terminals at Huelva, Tarragona and Cadiz, as well as  
one February cargo movement from Augusta, Sicily.

   
The 11,406 dwt Biskra was still located off Port Harcourt  
on 29 September, having arrived there on 23 September with  
the second of its two\-port discharges, the first having been  
into Sapele.

 Ghana/Ivory Coast/Cameroon
==========================

   
The prospect of an alternative Ghanaian bulk bitumen im\-  
porter was pushed back by a few months as local firm GOIL

delayed its 6,00t bitumen terminal project in the Tema port  
area.

   
The $35mm project in a joint venture with Ivory Coast  
bitumen producer SMB, also includes a 30t/hour capacity  
styrene\-butadiene\-styrene (SBS) polymer\-modified bitumen  
(PMB) plant as well as a 60t/hr emulsions unit. The proj\-  
ect had been slated for end\-September completion, but is  
now being targeted to be ready at the end of this year (see  
news).

   
Virtually all of Ghana's bulk cargo imports are currently  
made into its Takoradi terminal, mainly from SMB's Abidjan  
refinery and terminal complex, with Shell and Total receiv\-  
ing those volumes of AC\-10 and AC\-20 and selling them to  
local truck buyers.

   
The 4,900 dwt SMB time\-chartered San Biagio moved a  
cargo from the firm's Abidjan refinery and terminal com\-  
plex to Douala, Cameroon, arriving there on 29 September.  
Armed guards on board was indicated by vessel tracking  
services, underlining the continued security risks associated  
with shipping movements in the Gulf of Guinea.

 East Africa

   
Regional import prices for both drummed and bulk bitumen  
imports from the Mideast Gulf maintained their upward mo\-  
mentum amid gains in both fob and delivered prices.

   
The sharpest gains affected the Iranian drummed export  
trade to east African ports, with Iranian exports assessed  
$16/t up at $365\-380/t fob Bandar Abbas, while freight rates  
from Bandar Abbas to Mombasa, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam,  
Tanzania, were assessed $10/t up at $95\-100/t amid relent\-  
less gains in container shipping costs caused by global short\-  
age in that sector.

   
Market participants reported price indications into Kenya  
at values anywhere from $460/t up to the $475\-485/t cfr  
Mombasa range for direct shipments from Bandar Abbas and  
as high as $650\-660/t for indirect flows via Jebel Ali.

   
Regional suppliers said Iranian state\-owned IRISL and its  
HDS affiliate had raised direct shipping rates from Bandar  
Abbas to Mombasa and Dar es Salaam to $1,850\-1,950 per  
container ($90\-100/t), while some east Africa bound move\-  
ments made indirectly by international container ship\-  
ping lines were indicated as high as $5,000 per container  
($250/t).
