 Malaysia
========

   
Bitumen demand in Malaysia was stable\-to\-firm as most con\-  
struction projects across the country continued to operate  
at a steady pace.

   
Demand from the Klang Valley continued to occupy a  
large share of total volumes lifted, with bitumen demand  
from ongoing projects and premix plants remaining firm over  
the past three weeks.

   
The state\-owned refiner increased its tank truck prices  
to around 1,830\-1,880 ringgit/t ex\-Malacca ($437\-449/t).  
Prices from Port Klang rose similarly to around 1,870\-1,900/t  
ex\-Klang ($447\-454/t). Delivered prices in the north have  
also edged up to around 1,870\-1960 ringgit/t ($447\-466/t) in  
response an increase in listed prices from the state\-owned  
refiner's Prai facility.

   
Several players have expressed that erratic rainfall  
over several construction sites has affected the progress  
of projects, but demand across Peninsula Malaysia in the  
coming months is expected to remain firm as most construc\-  
tion projects continue to edge towards completion by end  
November.

 Thailand

   
Prices on a fob basis were assessed at $395\-405/t in line  
with the trend seen in Singapore.
