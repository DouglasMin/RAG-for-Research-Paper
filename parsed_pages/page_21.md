 German refinery consortium PCK has completed the restart  
of its 208,000 b/d Schwedt refinery in north eastern Ger\-  
many.

   
The plant is ramping up production in order to reach a  
80\-100pc utilisation rate. Repair works on a high conversion  
soaker cracking (HSC) unit will last until mid\-October, ac\-  
cording to one of the refinery's shareholders.

   
The PCK consortium comprises Russia's state\-controlled  
Rosneft, Shell and Italian energy firm Eni.

   
The facility was shut down by a regional electricity  
failure on 8 September. PCK began restart operations on the  
same day, but warned at the time that the process would  
take several days.

 Bahrain's state\-owned refiner Bapco will increase its bitu\-  
men listed prices by $15/t from 2 October on the back of  
higher crude and fuel oil prices.

   
This price hike will see listed prices increase to $440/t  
fob Sitra. This is the third time in a month Bapco has an\-  
nounced a price increase. It raised listed prices by $20/t  
on two occasions, first on 11 September and again on 19  
September.

   
Hikes in high\-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) prices have prompt\-  
ed regional refiners to switch to producing HSFO over bitu\-  
men.

 Romania's Midia refinery back to 'optimal'

   
Repairs at Romania's 100,000 b/d Midia refinery, in Navodari  
on the Black Sea coast, have been largely completed, with  
operations scheduled to return to "optimal" levels by the  
end of October, Kazakh\-owned operator Rompetrol Rafinare  
said.

   
The refinery had been offline since early\-July because of  
a fire, which killed three people and injured two others.

   
Rompetrol Rafinare is performing the last technical  
checks to resume production and Midia's installations will be  
restarted in stages. The operator of the refinery said that  
it is currently in the phase of starting up petrol and diesel  
production units.

   
Midia was previously expected to start on 20\-24 Septem\-  
ber. The plant already supplied some raw material to Rom\-  
petrol Rafinare's Vega bitumen plant in Ploiesti last week,  
suggesting some units were operating, but the operator  
declined to say whether the restarting process began then.

   
Midia's diesel hydrotreatment unit, where the fire broke  
out in July, has been "technologically isolated" and its re\-  
pairs and restart is scheduled for 2022, the company said.

   
The fire also affected the kerosene hydrotreater and  
catalytic reformer units, along with nearby pipes connected  
to the naphtha hydrotreater and saturated gases units, the  
company said last month.

 BTK's bitumen terminal to be upgraded

   
Bunkering company Baltic Fuel (BTK) has secured Rbs1bn  
($14mn) of financing for a two\-phase project to increase  
bitumen loadings at its Turukhtannye Ostrova terminal at St  
Petersburg port.

 BTK subsidiary Kontur reached a six\-year loan agreement  
with St Petersburg Bank for the project, which aims to add  
43,800m3 of storage and increase loading capacity for bitu\-  
men and vacuum residue \- a feedstock for bitumen produc\-  
tion \- as well as providing facilities to manufacture polymer\-  
modified bitumen. Turukhtannye Ostrova has capacity to  
handle about 1\.8mn t/yr of products, mainly fuel oil and  
gasoil, and more than 80,000m3 of tank\-farm space \- around
