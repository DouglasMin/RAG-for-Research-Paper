 SUMMARY

 Bitumen cargo values gained across Europe and Asia\-Pacific,  
boosted by a jump in crude and fuel oil values.

   
Domestic truck prices across Europe also mostly  
strengthened as October started.

   
Cargo premiums to high\-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) in Rot\-  
terdam and the Baltics fell by $2\-3/t, but outright values  
continued to rise, while in the Mediterranean premium  
values were steady on the week as refiners held their ground  
amid rising outright values and slowing demand.

   
The Asia\-Pacific bitumen market remained mostly firm,  
despite the expected slowdown due to the week\-long break  
in China for Golden Week holidays.

   
The continued buoyancy in crude and HSFO prices in the  
Asia\-Pacific region pushed refiners to either seek price hikes  
or mull production cuts at their units. Supply for October  
was seen to be balanced in key export export locations like  
Singapore and South Korea on the back of lower bitumen  
production at some units.

   
Demand is expected to improve from Vietnam, Australia,  
China and India in the coming weeks supported by seasonal  
pick\-up or the easing of pandemic\-related restrictions.

   
Bitumen prices shot up across sub\-Saharan Africa, with  
delivered cargo and drummed import prices racing higher, as  
did domestic and export values for South African volumes.
