Issue 21\-39 I Friday 1 October 2021 ASIA\-PACIFIC AND MIDDLE EAST MARKET COMMENTARY

 A deal for a 2,000\-3,000t cargo bound for central Viet\-  
nam, with a laycan period set in the first week of November,  
was at around $395\-400/t fob.

   
Regional traders have noted firmer buying indications  
from Vietnamese buyers for end October and first half No\-  
vember\-loading cargoes. Demand from Vietnam is expected  
to pick up in November, as the seasonal monsoon ends.

   
Domestic demand for bitumen was mostly muted. Floods  
across several regions in Thailand after tropical storm  
Dianmu has hit operations in multiple construction sites in  
Bangkok and other parts of central Thailand.

   
Domestic prices rose to around $490\-550/t ex\-refinery in  
response to higher crude prices. The higher cost of produc\-  
tion has necessitated an increase in its listed prices.

 Indonesia
=========

   
Bitumen demand in Indonesia continued to strengthen as the  
country approached its annual peak season for the bitumen  
market. Demand from the islands of Sumatra, Kalimantan  
and Sulawesi continued to be relatively firm on the back of  
ongoing projects.

   
A deal for a 1,500t Singapore origin cargo bound for  
Kalimantan with a loading period set in first half October  
was at above $430/t cfr Kalimantan. A 3,000t 1H October  
loading cargo bound for North Sulawesi was concluded at  
around $440/t cfr. Another deal for a 3,000t lot for first half  
October loading to South Sumatra was concluded at around  
$440/t cfr. A deal by a Singapore\-based trader totalling up to  
15,000t to be loaded across November and first half Decem\-  
ber was also done this week.

   
Buying ideas were in the $395\-410/t fob range for end  
October and early November loading cargoes. Most regional  
players have continued to indicate their preference for

lifting from the state\-owned refiner's terminals in Cilacap  
and Gresik as an alternative compared with higher\-priced  
cargoes from regional markets.

 Vietnam

   
More deals and discussions surfaced in Vietnam as demand  
firmed with the easing of lockdown. Some roadworks were  
also hampered this week by the ongoing wet weather.

   
An importer concluded two October loading cargoes from  
north Asia at $440\-445/t cfr, with one small volume loading  
for south Vietnam from Thailand and another 5,000t cargo to  
north Vietnam.

   
Two 3,000t cargoes from Singapore were concluded at  
$440/t cfr south Vietnam and $455/t cfr north Vietnam. This  
could not be confirmed with the buyer. Freight costs were  
estimated at $30\-35/t to south Vietnam and $45\-50/t to  
north Vietnam.

   
An offer for an end\-October loading cargo at $440/t cfr  
was seen from a Singapore\-based refiner, with the volume  
and discharge ports yet to be fixed. The cargo was under\-  
stood to be part of a larger shipment heading towards the  
north in end\-October. Other offers into Vietnam for second\-  
half October volumes were ranging between $445\-455/t cfr  
for cargoes of both southeast Asian and northeast Asia ori\-  
gins, with most buying ideas at $440\-445/t cfr. Discussions  
for November volumes had yet to commence.

 South Korea

   
Prices in South Korea were unchanged on the back of limited  
discussions or trades concluded.
