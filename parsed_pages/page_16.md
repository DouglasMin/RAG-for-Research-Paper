most buyers preferring to delay negotiations until after 8  
October. In east China, an offer for an October\-loading South  
Korean cargo was at 3,250 yuan/t. About 7,000t of October\-  
loading cargo from South Korea were also concluded at  
3,300\-3,350 yuan/t to east China. This could not be con\-  
firmed. Another importer concluded a very prompt 5,000  
South Korean cargo which loaded this week at $424/t cfr  
east China.

   
In south China, no firm discussions for imports were  
seen amid scant buying interest. An offer for November and  
December\-loading cargoes from a Singapore\-based refiner  
was made at $460/t cfr south China.

   
Higher freight rates were quoted for cargoes from South  
Korea to east China, with ship owners having to contend  
with higher demurrage fees due to ongoing port congestion,  
particularly along the Yangtze River. Freight rates were at  
$38\-45/t for 5,000t cargoes, though few to no buyers were  
willing to take the higher offers.

 Australia \& New Zealand

   
In the state of Victoria, the ongoing construction sector  
shutdown in Melbourne and other areas will be lifted from 5  
October, with stringent Covid\-19 measures in place. One sell\-  
er estimated a reduction of around 50pc of sales this week  
due to the shutdown, with some slowdown also attributed  
to the wet weather. Overall demand is expected to pick up  
gradually in October and firm further in November.

   
Discussions were ongoing for November\-loading cargoes,  
with indicative offers at higher than current fob Singapore  
levels. One importer also concluded a 7,000t cargo from  
southeast Asia for loading mid\-November on a formula basis.

   
In New Zealand, demand from Auckland is expected to  
reach similar levels to the rest of the country gradually, with  
roadworks picking up despite the city remaining under the  
stricter "level 3" Covid\-19 measures. Ullage levels remain  
manageable with importers citing no need to delay or divert  
incoming cargoes.

 India

   
In the Indian market, demand is slowly returning as the  
monsoon is nearing its end. Roadworks are picking up slowly  
in parts of the country with the monsoon expected to end in  
another 10 days time.

   
Buying of bulk and drummed parcels from Iran picked up  
this week but port inventories remain on the high side, thus  
deterring a firm upturn. Local refiners also raised prices for  
bulk by 1,600 Indian rupees/t and for drummed cargoes by  
2,600 Indian rupees/t from 1 October.
