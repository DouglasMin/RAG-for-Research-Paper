Issue 21\-39 I Friday 1 October 2021 SUB\-SAHARAN AFRICA MARKET COMMENTARY
=====================================

 only be served by international shipping lines moving moves  
in directly via UAE ports, principally Jebel Ali.

   
Iranian bulk cargo exports were assessed $10\-11/t up at  
$290\-305/t fob Bandar Abbas, while Bahraini state\-owned re\-  
finer Bapco announced it would raise its listed cargo export  
price by $15/t to $440/t fob Sitra with effect from 2 October  
in the wake of two sets of hikes over the past month.

 Kenya/Uganda/South Sudan
========================

   
Regional suppliers pointed to more busy rates of construc\-  
tion activity and bitumen requirements in Kenya, Uganda  
and South Sudan.

   
While supply of Iranian drummed bitumen remains tight  
amid container shipping and container shortages as well as  
regular delays in such shipping movements, especially on Ira\-  
nian state\-owned IRISL vessels, bulk cargo supply movements  
have helped to alleviate some of the availability issues in  
east African markets.

   
The 3,764 dwt R Ocean was set to deliver its bulk cargo  
into the Skytrade Global terminal in Mombasa after its  
scheduled 10 October arrival with its cargo loaded in the  
Mideast Gulf, following the previous 30 August delivery  
on the same tanker. While nearly all the volumes in the  
previous shipment have already been delivered to local and  
regional buyers, around half of the new shipment's volume  
was understood to have already been pre\-sold by the week  
ending 1 October.

   
Domestic drummed and bulk truck prices were expected  
to face upward pressure because of the spike in delivered  
values into Mombasa, Kenya. Bulk truck volumes were  
indicated at Kenyan Shillings 71\-73/kg ($642\-660/t) ex\-works  
Mombasa, while drummed sales were at KES73\-74/kg ($660\-  
669/t) and expected to rise in early October to as high as  
KES75/kg ($679/t).

   
Southern Africa

   
South African domestic and truck export prices jumped,  
with some of the export flows now indicated at around Rand  
8,300/t ($550\-560/t) ex\-works.

   
A steady stream of requirements was reported into Zam\-  
bia, Malawi and Botswana, with drummed flows also heading  
into Zimbabwe from neighbouring South Africa.

 South Africa

   
Domestic truck prices shot up as South African refiners dra\-  
matically raised their prices to reflect large gains in crude  
and other feedstock costs during September as well as a  
weakening Rand against the US dollar.

   
Gains of R700\-800/t from some suppliers were reported  
by market participants to have already taken effect from  
1 October, with assessments rising R750/t to the R9,200\-  
9,600/t ex\-works range.

   
Rates of construction activity have been rising during the  
current peak season period that began on 1 September, with  
buoyant rates of project work reported in KwaZulu\-Natal  
and Eastern Cape provinces. Some of that work is con\-  
nected with construction of the multi\-billion Rand Msikaba  
and Mtentu bridges that will form part of the N2 Wild Coast  
mega road project. Funding allocations for the next round  
of South African National Roads Authority (Sanral) backed  
projects was awaited, with those projects most likely to  
start sometime in 2022\.
