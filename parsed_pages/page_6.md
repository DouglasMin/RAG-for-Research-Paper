Argus Bitumen   
Issue 21\-39 \| Friday 1 October 2021 MEDITERRANEAN MARKET COMMENTARY
===============================

 Summary
=======

   
Mediterranean bitumen cargo prices ended September  
with sharp gains as high\-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) prices rose  
substantially, while bitumen cargo premiums stabilised after  
declining for much of the month.

   
Spanish export premiums to HSFO were assessed un\-  
changed at $20\-25/t fob, Greek fob cargo premiums were  
assessed unchanged at $15\-20/t, with most Turkish export  
flows indicated in the same range, while Italian fob cargo  
premiums were also assessed unchanged at $15\-20/t. The  
impact of a lack of westbound transatlantic arbitrage op\-  
portunities, as well as a general demand slowdown within  
the Mediterranean basin was leading to greater availabilities  
across the region.

   
Delivered values into key north African markets were  
falling, with some delivered premium offers in the low  
$50's/t into Algerian terminals in October, although most  
indications into Algeria and Morocco were still in the high  
$50s/t, while delivered Egyptian values for end\-October  
were also in the same high $50s/t to HSFO delivered area.

   
The gains in Mediterranean outright values made it yet  
more unprofitable to move spot arbitrage cargoes to the US  
east, with Spanish fob levels surging to around $460/t fob  
during the last week of September, higher than cif US east  
coast cargoes that were trading around $450/t.

   
Egyptian state\-refiner EGPC awarded a further 5,000\-  
6,000t cargo to trading firm BGN at a $57/t delivered pre\-  
mium, basis Alexandria, for end\-October delivery, additional  
to the firm's original four\-cargo tender awarded to Puma  
Energy and 3B Trading.

   
Cross\-Mediterranean freight rates were assessed $1\-2/t  
down on shorter routes and $2\-3/t on the longer routes  
amid clear signs of reduced demand for cargoes as well as  
tankers to move them. That has led to indications, as the
