 On a fob South Korea basis, no sell tenders were award\-  
ed. But a key refiner is expected to open a sell tender for  
its November loading cargoes in the coming weeks. Demand  
from China remains weak and is anticipated to remain a  
bearish factor for the Korean sellers.

   
Meanwhile, some key refineries are continuing to produce  
less bitumen on the back of strong HSFO economics. The  
reduced physical volumes of bitumen has helped to balance  
the overall supply availability for October.

   
Domestic prices in South Korea were raised by $51/t for  
October, as recent firmness in crude values lent to higher  
domestic selling prices. Demand outlook for October remains  
slightly mixed, with local players wary of the recent spike  
in Covid\-19 cases following the Thanksgiving festival holiday  
recently.

   
In Japan, domestic prices were raised by ¥1,000/t to  
¥63,513\-71,619/t ex\-tank. Demand in September has been  
mostly stable against the previous month. More roadworks  
are expected to commence in October, though some proj\-  
ects might slow down with the upcoming general elections  
in November. Some sellers were anticipating slightly tighter  
supply in October, with one refiner's terminal in Yokohama  
undergoing maintenance. This could not be confirmed.

 Taiwan
======

   
In line with regional price movements, export prices from  
Taiwan were assessed $2\.50/t higher to $400\-405/t fob  
Taiwan.

   
Volumes from the private refiner remain limited, with  
no indications given on production levels for November and  
December.

   
Reduced volumes have also prompted buyers to seek  
alternative cargoes of other origins.  
Domestic prices from the state\-owned refiner were un\-  
changed at NT17,000/t ex\-tank.

 China

   
Limited negotiations were seen in China with the country  
heading into the week\-long break for Golden Week celebra\-  
tions from 1\-7 October.

   
A key state\-owned refiner raised its domestic listed  
prices by 20\-70 yuan/t for key refineries in east China and  
by 50 yuan/t for refineries in the south. The upward revi\-  
sions were seen as mostly in line with the firmness in global  
crude prices, with domestic demand expected to improve  
post\-Golden Week. Another smaller state\-owned refiner  
also raised listed prices by 230 yuan/t at its terminal in the  
southwest.

   
Ongoing power shortages in parts of China had limited  
impact on production. Some refineries in areas affected by  
power shortages may have slowed the rate of production,  
but supply levels were mostly unaffected.

   
A state\-owned refinery in Shandong also resumed opera\-  
tions on 25 September after a planned turnaround. Two  
refineries in the east and in the south are due to undergo a  
month\-long maintenance from October. Overall supply levels  
are expected to remain ample with the refiner planning to  
raise overall bitumen production by about 50,000\-100,000t  
in October. The planned increment comes on the back of re\-  
duced petroleum coke production which has been curtailed  
due to carbon emission reduction plans.

   
Few discussions for imported cargoes were seen with
