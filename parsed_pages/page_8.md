 Italy
=====

   
Fob cargo premiums to Mediterranean HSFO prices from Ital\-  
ian export terminals were assessed unchanged at $15\-20/t  
with greater availability being indicated by some market  
participants as regional demand begins to slow down.

   
Italian domestic demand remained buoyant, but prices  
were unchanged going into October, with market partici\-  
pants anticipating activity and demand to remain steady at  
strong levels during much of the fourth quarter.

   
Strong gains in fuel oil and crude values have been the  
main driver of upward revisions of domestic Italian values,  
with some market participants anticipating renewed bitu\-  
men truck price hikes during October as refiners aim to keep  
pace with rising crude oil prices.

   
Domestic truck prices were assessed unchanged in the  
week ending 1 October at €390\-400/t ex\-works, including  
the €31/t domestic duty on sales of road paving penetra\-  
tion grades, while truck export prices into southern France  
as well as Switzerland were indicated around €365\-375/t  
ex\-works.

   
The 6,165 dwt An Hai Wan loaded a cargo from Tarra\-  
gona, Spain, for discharge into Naples, while the 5,897 dwt  
Iver Action loaded a cargo from Augusta for discharge into  
the southern French port of Lavera by 2 October.

 Greece

   
Greek export cargo premiums to fob Mediterranean HSFO  
cargoes were assessed unchanged at $15\-20/t fob, with  
market participants indicating offers within that range for  
prompt loadings.

   
Demand for Greek loading spot cargoes was however thin  
amid a general downturn in Mediterranean demand heading  
into the fourth quarter, while refiners were highly reluctant  
to allow their spot cargoes to be sold at markedly lower val\-  
ues than those agreed under their annual contractual deals  
for 2021 supplies.

   
Domestic Greek truck prices gained significant ground,  
rising €24/t, with ex\-works offers from Hellenic Petroleum's  
Aspropyrgos and Thessaloniki refineries at €424/t and  
€426/t ex\-works respectively, while truck sales from Motor  
Oil Hellas' Agio Theodori refinery were indicated at €424/t  
ex\-works. Trucks continued to be sent into the Romanian  
market, with a Greek firm sending a further 30 trucks into  
the country from its storage tanks at Thessaloniki in antici\-  
pation of pick up in Romania activity and demand by the end  
of October as money begins to reach more constructors in a  
rush to complete road projects before winter.

   
The 4,999 dwt Sunpower loaded a cargo from Aspro\-  
pyrgos for discharge into Mangalia on Romania's Black Sea  
coast. The 37,000 dwt Asphalt Synergy loaded a cargo on 22  
September from Agio Theodori and was located near Gibral\-  
tar on 1 October, with no end destination as yet clear for  
its cargo. The 6,065 dwt Fuji Lava was loading a cargo from  
Aspropyrgos on 30 September, having previously discharged  
a cargo into Nikolaev, Ukraine.

 Turkey
======

   
Domestic prices in Turkey continued their recent run of  
strength with posted prices at Tupras' refineries surging  
TL313\-314/t to TL4,718/t ex\-works Izmit and Izmir refineries  
and to TL4,762/t ex\-works Batman and Kirikkale refineries,  
with those values effective from 28 September.

   
The rise in prices is in part a result of higher crude  
values and a weakening Turkish Lira, but market participants  
also noted a slowdown in imports from Iraqi Kurdistan and  
other Iraqi export points, with production lower in part  
linked to rising vacuum residue feedstock costs and specifi\-  
cation issues on some bitumen grades.

   
Domestic Turkish demand was also picking up pace in  
a final rush to complete works by constructors before the  
usual winter halt in activity from December.

   
A second cargo from the Mideast Gulf is expected in the  
coming weeks into the Toros Gubre terminal at Ceyhan, with  
as yet no clear indication of which tanker is to make that  
journey or any firm shipment dates.
