Argus Bitumen   
Issue 21\-39 \| Friday 1 October 2021 NORTH AND CENTRAL EUROPE MARKET COMMENTARY

 Summary
=======

   
Domestic truck prices strengthened in several markets,  
many of those gains linked to monthly revisions for October  
supplies, while cargo prices also jumped.

   
While German domestic prices were assessed €10/t  
firmer after some price erosion caused by plentiful supply  
and high stocks being sold off during September, other key  
northwest European markets like Benelux, UK and France  
registered €20/t, £20/t and €20\-25/t gains respectively.  
But not all monthly deals between sellers and buyers had  
been agreed and confirmed by 1 October, with more details  
expected from 4 October.

   
Czech domestic and export prices also strengthened  
on tight refinery supply, although there was still plentiful  
availability overall in most central and southeast European  
markets.

   
Sharp gains in fob Rotterdam high\-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO)  
prices in the last week of September drove up outright  
bitumen values, but such gains coupled with early signs of  
winter and demand slowdown in parts of the Nordic/Scandi\-  
navia region encouraged a modest $2\-3/t slippage in Rot\-  
terdam and Baltic cargo export premiums to HSFO that were  
assessed at $25\-30/t and around $20/t fob respectively.

   
Cross regional freight rates for standard 5,000t cargoes  
were yet to be pushed down significantly, but slim assessed  
declines took Thames\-bound rates to $22\-24/t from Rotter\-  
dam, $29\-31/t from Hamburg, $47\-49/t from Klaipeda and  
$39\-43/t from La Coruna.
