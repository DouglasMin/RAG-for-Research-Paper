Issue 21\-39 \| Friday 1 October 2021 ASIA\-PACIFIC AND MIDDLE EAST MARKET COMMENTARY

 Singapore
=========

   
Singapore bitumen prices edged up another $5/t this week,  
supported by stronger deals and discussions among local  
sellers and regional buyers.

   
On a fob Singapore basis, a key trader sold about 15,000t  
in total to Indonesian buyers at $410/t for November\-loading.  
Several deals for October loading were also concluded at  
about $405\-410/t levels. Two more deals to be loaded in  
end\-October were also concluded into Vietnam on a cfr  
basis, with fob values at $405\-410/t.

   
Offers from refiners and local traders ranged at $415\-  
425/t for late\-October/early\-November loading cargoes that  
met bids or buying indications in the $405\-410/t range.

   
Supply from Singapore is expected to be more balanced  
in October on the back of production loss from 2\-3 key  
refiners. The persistent negative spread between bitumen  
and high\-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) could be pushing refiners to  
incentivise production of HSFO versus bitumen.

   
Tank truck prices from Singapore have continued to rise  
and were at $406\-415/t ex\-refinery. Demand in Malaysia has  
been slowing again from the central region of Peninsular  
Malaysia, following the recent pick\-up.

   
Prices of tank trucks from Singapore jumped to around  
$415\-430/t ex\-refinery. Regional players have also noted that  
tighter bitumen supply across Singapore and Malaysia has  
resulted in higher prices for tank trucks. An offer into Johore  
was at around 1920 ringgit/t ($456/t) on a delivered basis.

   
Domestic prices in Singapore were raised by $20\.50/t to  
$420\-445/t ex\-tank for October on the back of higher crude  
values in the past month. Domestic demand is expected  
to however remain flat against September, with manpower  
limitations and expected wet weather to hamper works.
