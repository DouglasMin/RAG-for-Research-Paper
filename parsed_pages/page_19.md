 Narrow margins pressure Iran's bitumen

   
Iranian bitumen production fell by an estimated 22pc during  
March\-August, faced by the double whammy of higher costs  
of production and weak demand from key markets.

   
Iran's VB feed sales volume fell by about 22pc from  
2\.962mn t to 2\.314mn t between 22 March and 22 August  
2021 compared with the same period last year. As a result,  
bitumen production also fell by at least about 22pc during  
the same period.

   
Meanwhile, bitumen sellers have seen weak demand in  
domestic as well as regional markets. Producers have also  
seen an increasing squeeze on margins on the rising cost of  
VB feed prices. This, coupled with stronger high\-sulphur fuel  
oil (HSFO) economics, has resulted in higher production of  
fuel oil and has reduced export volumes.

   
"We reduced trading activities for bitumen as there is  
no profit margin, and have switched to other products," said  
several local traders.

   
"As a producer, we have faced losses over the past  
months and were forced to sell our cargoes only to pay our  
debts from purchasing VB feed that was bought earlier," said  
several producers.

   
As a result, the number of companies trading or selling  
bitumen within Iran has fallen over the past few months.

   
A gap was seen in buy\-sell expectations as higher offers  
based on higher costs of production were rejected by buy\-  
ers from key markets. This was further underpinned by the  
impact of Covid\-19, which resulted in issues with government  
funds and slowed paving activities in recent months.

   
"We purchased VB feed at 70,274 rials/kg \[$285/t] and  
produced bitumen at $315/t fob, including storage and VAT  
costs, but we have sold without any profit," said industry  
participants. The government did not give a tax rebate to

many exporters in the past two years and imposed a bitu\-  
men export tax from March 2021 onwards.

   
VB feed supply fell by 21pc from 3\.24mm t to 2\.56mn t  
between 22 March and 22 August this year. This was sup\-  
ported by a possible move by Iranian refineries to increase  
fuel oil production because of higher demand, in contrast to  
weak demand from bitumen producers.

   
On the other hand, Iran's bitumen exports in August slid  
by 32pc compared with a month earlier and was 48pc lower  
year\-on\-year amid low demand from Asian markets. Exports  
fell to about 221,730t in August, down from 326,000t sold  
in July. Meanwhile Iran's export sales stood at 431,000t in  
August 2020, according to data from the Iran Mercantile  
Exchange.

 Bitumen demand from Vietnam looks set to increase in the  
next few years, supported by an ambitious road develop\-  
ment plan that seeks to construct over 5,000km of express\-  
ways between 2021\-2030\.

   
The Road Network Development Plan which was unveiled  
this month seeks to develop over 5,000km of expressways in  
the country by 2030, up from 3,841km in 2021\.

   
Key areas for expressway development include exten\-  
sions to the ongoing North\-South Expressway project, as well  
as the 14 expressways in the north, which alone would total  
about 2,305km. It also includes 10 expressways making up  
around 1,431km in the central and central highlands region,  
and another 10 expressways totalling around 1,290km in the  
south.

   
On top of the new additions to the expressways, there  
are also plans for 172 national highway routes totalling
