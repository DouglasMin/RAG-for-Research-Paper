Argus Bitumen   
Issue 21\-39 I Friday 1 October 2021 ASIA\-PACIFIC AND MIDDLE EAST MARKET COMMENTARY

 demand is slowly firming, amid thin supply of Iraqi drums.  
A producer sold 10,000t in drums at $365\-367/t to Sri Lanka  
and India. A total 10,000t of pen 60/70 in drums traded at  
$365\-367/t to Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and India on cash pay\-  
ment basis.

   
Total 2,000t were sold at $375/t for October laycan to  
east Africa. A 5,000t Jey\-embossed cargo sold at $373\-376/t  
fob, while several small cargoes were sold at $365\-370/t to  
Tanzania, Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh and the UAE. A total  
5,000t in drums sold at $415\-420/t cfr Turkmenistan for  
prompt delivery, with freight and logistic charges estimated  
at $65/t.

   
Private shipping companies imposed a new General Rate  
Increase (GRI) for transshipment cargoes from Jebel Ali at  
an average $100/container ($5/t) from 26 September. In ad\-  
dition to this, direct shipments from Iran to Kenya rose from  
$1,550/container to $1,850/container from this week, while  
no container was available by IRISL for exporters.

   
Jumbo bag prices remained stable at $350\-360/t, but  
demand was thin due to the low gap with drum cargoes.  
Iraqi bitumen supply has weakened over the past month and  
a major producer was offered drum cargoes at $355\-360/t,  
while a 10,000t drum cargo was sold at $335\-340/t early  
this week to Myanmar and India. Market players said Iraqi  
vacuum residue (VR) feed price rose sharply and availability  
of VR in north Iraq fell sharply and several bitumen produc\-  
ers in Kurdistan region has halted production.

   
On the IME, prices moved up as competition rose be\-  
tween buyers. Jey Oil sold 8,000t of pen 60/70 in bulk at  
86,206 rials/kg ($316/t) ex\-Bandar Abbas, up by $10/t. Jey  
Oil also sold 7,000t at 80,350 rials/kg ($294/t)ex\-Esfahan, up  
around 3,900 rials/kg week\-on\-week and 10,000t in drums  
were sold at 93,009\-97,666 rials/kg ($341\-358/t) ex\-Esfahan.

   
Pasargad Oil increased prices to around 4,050 rials/  
kg ($14/t) and sold 5,000t bulk on 81,700 rials/kg ($300/t)  
ex\-Bandar Abbas. Another 2,000t in bulk was sold at 76,961  
rials/kg ex\-Arak refinery, while 10,000t bulk of pen 60/70  
sold at 76,950 rials/kg ($283/t) ex\-Abadan.

 Iran local market

   
VB feed prices continued on an upward trend as the Oil Re\-  
fining Industry Association (Orica) revised VB feed prices on  
25 September. VB feed prices from Bandar Abbas and Shiraz  
Refineries were announced at 75,244 rials/kg, up by 4,970  
rials/kg ($18/t) and from other refineries at 71,661 rials/kg,  
up by 4,733 rials/kg ($17\.5/t).

   
But buying interest was healthy due to lowered VB sup\-

   
ply by refineries and expectations of further rise in prices  
in the coming revision, led by hikes in crude and HSFO  
prices. About 202,000t demand registered for VB feed, while  
103,000t was sold by refineries on IME this week.

   
Bandar Abbas refinery announced a planned maintenance  
for a month from mid\-October. VB feed supply from Bandar  
Abbas refinery is likely to drop by 50pc from this week until  
the end of November. Bandar Abbas Refinery offered 20,000t  
of VB feed at 75,244 rials/kg and 71,000t demand was regis\-  
tered. They finally sold 20,000t at an average of 78,919 rials/  
kg.

   
Tehran Refinery may also undergo maintenance from  
mid\-October and likely will reduce VB feed supply too.  
Tehran Refinery sold 20,000t of VB feed at 75,421 rial/kg, up  
by 4,000 rials/kg ($14\.50/t). Esfahan Refinery sold 10,000t  
at 75,004 rials/kg, up by 4,000 rials/kg ($14\.50/t). Tabriz  
Refinery sold 8,000t at 71,616 rials/kg, up by 3,100 rials/kg.  
Abadan Refinery sold 20,000t at 71,661\-74,999 rials/kg. Arak  
Refinery sold 25,000t at 74,570 rials/kg, up by about 6,000  
rials/kg. Shiraz Refinery sold 10,000t at 75,244 rials/kg, up  
by about 3,000 rials/kg.

   
Bitumen prices rose in the domestic market, following a  
surge in VB feed prices and producers sold 4,308t of differ\-  
ent products at 74,000\-110,000 rials/kg on IME.
