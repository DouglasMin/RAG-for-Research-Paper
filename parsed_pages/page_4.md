Issue 21\-39 I Friday 1 October 2021 NORTH AND CENTRAL EUROPE MARKET COMMENTARY

 The market was also being supported by buoyant levels  
of construction work and bitumen requirements throughout  
September, with suppliers also pointing to healthy order  
books into October and November.

   
Bitumen availability from domestic refineries and ter\-  
minals, buoyed by steady cargo import flows, has also been  
high, keeping the UK bitumen market broadly balanced.  
Cargoes delivered into Thames terminals jumped in in the  
last week of September to an indicated $495\-500/t (£365\-  
370/t) cfr range.

   
UK government data showed domestic bitumen consump\-  
tion at 156,00t in July, down 6,000t on the same month of  
last year. For the May to July period this year consumption  
stood at 485,000t, up 59,000t on the same period of 2020\.  
For year\-to\-date January to July, UK consumption stood at  
1\.05mn t, against 817,000t last year, after the negative im\-  
pact on construction activity and demand in 2020 caused by  
Covid\-19 lockdowns, particularly from March to May.

 France
======

   
French domestic prices rose by €20\-25/t, reflecting sharp  
gains in agreed prices for the new month of October, al\-  
though not all supply deal values were yet finalised in discus\-  
sions between buyers and sellers.

 Relatively higher product availability in the north and  
centre, as compared with southern France, kept assessed  
gains in the former regions to €20/t to reach the €475\-485/t  
delivered range, while €25/t assessed in the south took  
those values to €445\-455/t delivered. The partial mainte\-  
nance shutdown since early\-September at the Petroineos  
refinery in Lavera on the French Mediterranean coast \-  
expected to last until early November \- was a key factor  
behind hefty October price hikes, with some domestic

suppliers in France seeking monthly price hikes as high as  
€30\-40/t and in one case as much as €60/t.

   
The return to normal production and supply from Exxon\-  
Mobil's Port\-Jerome refinery in Normandy, northern France,  
was taking longer than anticipated after the plant was hit by  
a fire in early September. But both cargo and truck buyers  
pointed to a steady improvement in the supply position and  
an anticipated return to normal flows after 4 October.

 Benelux

   
Domestic truck prices in Benelux markets were assessed  
€20/t firmer at $420\-435/t ex\-works, after October price  
hikes following crude and fuel oil gains during September.

   
While some monthly deals appeared to have been com\-  
pleted, especially in the Netherlands, with price hikes of  
around €20/t for October supplies versus September values,  
some talks, especially in Belgium, were expected to take  
a few more days, with some supplier hikes of up to €40/t  
being sought in ongoing negotiations in a bid to make up  
for some of the large gains in crude and HSFO prices during  
September, pushing up refinery feedstock costs along with a  
weakening euro versus dollar.

   
Local market participants pointed to normal activity  
levels for the time of year, with some expecting October to  
be the busiest month of the year.

 Germany
=======

   
Modest price gains were registered on the domestic truck  
market, effective from 1 October, after intra\-month declines  
during September when high stocks held by some refinery  
and terminal locations were being sold off.

   
Domestic demand has also remained below expectations  
for the season, underlined by fresh German Bafa data that  
showed bitumen deliveries domestically were 211,102t for  
July this year, down 17,000t on the same month of 2020\. For  
the year until July deliveries for Germany domestic con\-  
sumption were 1\.02mn t, compared to 1\.07mn t in 2020, a  
drop of 4\.4pc.

   
Total refinery production of bitumen was 451,969t in  
July, up by 82,359t on the same month of 2020\. For the year  
until July production stood at 2\.19mm t, compared to 1\.99mn  
t last year, an increase of 10\.2pc.

   
Domestic prices were assessed €10/t up at €385\-395/t  
ex\-works in the north, €350\-360/t ex\-works in the northeast  
and €365\-380/t ex\-works in the southwest.
