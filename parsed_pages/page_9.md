Issue 21\-39 I Friday 1 October 2021 SUB\-SAHARAN AFRICA MARKET COMMENTARY

 Summary
=======

   
Bitumen prices shot up across sub\-Saharan Africa, with deliv\-  
ered cargo and drummed import prices racing higher, as did  
domestic and export values for South African volumes.

   
The demand picture was fairly buoyant in several south\-  
ern and east African markets, while the rainy season was  
still keeping a lid on west African activity rates.

 West Africa

   
Cargo prices for delivery into regional import terminals  
surged as a renewed spike in crude and high\-sulphur fuel oil  
(HSFO) prices drove up outright bitumen values.

   
Spanish and Ivory Coast cargo premiums to fob Mediter\-  
ranean HSFO cargoes were assessed unchanged at $20\-25/t  
and around $115/t fob respectively after recent declines and  
amid marked reluctance amongst major European refinery  
suppliers to export product at yet lower premiums than  
under their existing contractual arrangements for 2021 sales.

   
Freight rate assessments for standard 5,000t spot cargo  
movements from Spanish to Nigerian ports stayed in the  
$150\-160/t range, but mounting downward pressures on  
cross\-Mediterranean rates could exert similar pressure on  
west Africa\-bound and intra\-regional freight rates over the  
coming weeks.

   
West African construction activity and bitumen demand  
levels remained subdued as rainy season conditions saw no  
sign of letting up. The greatest concentration of rainfall  
affecting the southern and western parts of the region, prin\-  
cipally Nigeria, Cameroon, Ivory Coast and Ghana.

   
The 45,974 dwt Bitu Express arrived at the 36,000t  
capacity Rubis deep\-water terminal at Lome, Togo, on 26  
September with a large cargo loaded at the Agio Theodori  
terminal in Greece. The volume helped bolster regional
