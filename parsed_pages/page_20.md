 29,795km by 2030, and 3,034km of coastal roads spanning 28  
cities and provinces.

   
The road development plan is one of the five master  
blueprints for the country's transport sector, which include  
plans for high\-speed rail routes, sea ports and new inter\-  
national airports to be constructed between this year and  
2030\. The investment capital for the plan is estimated to be  
about 900,000bn dong ($39\.6bn), according to a draft issued  
by Vietnam's Ministry of Transport. The bulk of the project  
funding is expected to come from public\-private partnership  
(PPP) investment.

unveiled a new PPP framework to support the country's  
development plans, where investors of projects in transpor\-  
tation, healthcare, education, power transmission and water  
sectors can receive benefits such as tax reductions or credit  
support, among others.

   
Vietnam does not produce bitumen, which is used in  
road construction. The country imported close to 890,000t  
of bitumen in 2020, the highest in the last five years. New  
road construction projects are expected to continue as the  
government pushes for infrastructure development in tan\-  
dem with economic goals, and has positioned Vietnam as an  
attractive business hub.

   
The road development plan is also aligned with Vietnam's  
11th Socio\-Economic Development Plan (SEDP), which covers  
the period of 2021\-2025 and includes the goal of achieving  
an average Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 6\.5\-7pc in the  
next five years.

 Ghana's new bitumen terminal delayed

   
Ghanaian state\-owned oil and gas marketing firm Goil has  
pushed back the completion date for a new $35mm bitumen  
terminal and conversion project at the port of Tema to the  
end of this year.

   
The 6,000t terminal \- which will supply imported AC\-10  
and AC\-20 bitumen performance grades to newly built poly\-  
mer\-modified bitumen (PMB) and bitumen emulsions plants  
\- had been slated for completion by the end of this month.  
Covid\-related issues are understood to be partly responsible  
for the delay.

   
Goil's joint venture partner in the project is Ivory Coast  
bitumen producer and exporter SMB, which has 300,000 t/yr  
of bitumen production capacity at its Abidjan refinery. The  
project was announced in 2017 and construction work began  
two years later. It is now 94pc complete.

   
Once operations start, bitumen imports into Tema will be  
fed to the terminal by a 3km pipeline, which will be electri\-  
cally heated to keep the road paving product liquid before it  
is discharged into Goil's newly built storage tanks.

   
The imported bitumen will then feed into the styrene\-  
butadiene\-styrene PMB plant, which will have the capacity  
to produce 30 t/hour. Some local market participants expect  
increased use of PMB in major road and highway projects in  
Ghana over the coming years.

   
One domestic construction sector player said its use had  
yet to be pursued aggressively by the country's highways au\-  
thorities. The bitumen emulsions plant will have a capacity  
of 60 t/hr. Bitumen emulsions are already in much wider use  
in Ghana than PMB.
