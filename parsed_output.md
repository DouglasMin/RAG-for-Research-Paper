# Summary

Bitumen cargo values gained across Europe and Asia-Pacific, boosted by a jump in crude and fuel oil values. Domestic truck prices across Europe also mostly strengthened as October started. Cargo premiums to high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) in Rotterdam and the Baltics fell by $2-3/t, but outright values continued to rise, while in the Mediterranean premium values were steady on the week as refiners held their ground amid rising outright values and slowing demand. The Asia-Pacific bitumen market remained mostly firm, despite the expected slowdown due to the week-long break in China for Golden Week holidays. The continued buoyancy in crude and HSFO prices in the Asia-Pacific region pushed refiners to either seek price hikes or mull production cuts at their units. Supply for October was seen to be balanced in key export locations like Singapore and South Korea on the back of lower bitumen production at some units. Demand is expected to improve from Vietnam, Australia, China and India in the coming weeks supported by seasonal pick-up or the easing of pandemic-related restrictions. Bitumen prices shot up across sub-Saharan Africa, with delivered cargo and drummed import prices racing higher, as did domestic and export values for South African volumes.

The market was also being supported by buoyant levels of construction work and bitumen requirements throughout September, with suppliers also pointing to healthy order books into October and November.

Bitumen availability from domestic refineries and terminals, buoyed by steady cargo import flows, has also been high, keeping the UK bitumen market broadly balanced. Cargoes delivered into Thames terminals jumped in the last week of September to an indicated $495-500/t (£365-370/t) cfr range.

UK government data showed domestic bitumen consumption at 156,000t in July, down 6,000t on the same month of last year. For the May to July period this year consumption stood at 485,000t, up 59,000t on the same period of 2020. For year-to-date January to July, UK consumption stood at 1.05mn t, against 817,000t last year, after the negative impact on construction activity and demand in 2020 caused by Covid-19 lockdowns, particularly from March to May.

# France

French domestic prices rose by €20-25/t, reflecting sharp gains in agreed prices for the new month of October, although not all supply deal values were yet finalised in discussions between buyers and sellers.

Relatively higher product availability in the north and centre, as compared with southern France, kept assessed gains in the former regions to €20/t to reach the €475-485/t delivered range, while €25/t assessed in the south took those values to €445-455/t delivered. The partial maintenance shutdown since early-September at the Petroineos refinery in Lavera on the French Mediterranean coast — expected to last until early November — was a key factor behind hefty October price hikes, with some domestic suppliers in France seeking monthly price hikes as high as €30-40/t and in one case as much as €60/t.

The return to normal production and supply from Exxon-Mobil's Port-Jerome refinery in Normandy, northern France, was taking longer than anticipated after the plant was hit by a fire in early September. But both cargo and truck buyers pointed to a steady improvement in the supply position and an anticipated return to normal flows after 4 October.

# Germany: North vs South

|Region|Price (€)|
|---|---|
|Northern Germany|425|
|Southern Germany|400|

Modest price gains were registered on the domestic truck market, effective from 1 October, after intra-month declines during September when high stocks held by some refinery and terminal locations were being sold off.

Domestic demand has also remained below expectations for the season, underlined by fresh German Bafa data that showed bitumen deliveries domestically were 211,102t for July this year, down 17,000t on the same month of 2020. For the year until July deliveries for Germany domestic consumption were 1.02mn t, compared to 1.07mn t in 2020, a drop of 4.4pc.

Total refinery production of bitumen was 451,969t in July, up by 82,359t on the same month of 2020. For the year until July production stood at 2.19mn t, compared to 1.99mn t last year, an increase of 10.2pc.

Domestic prices were assessed €10/t up at €385-395/t ex-works in the north, €350-360/t ex-works in the northeast and €365-380/t ex-works in the southwest.

Thanks to better weather encouraging more construction work, while market participants pointed to higher prices from refiners in the country with ex-works prices rising for October supplies as a result of crude gains.

Some market participants also pointed to the potential for further price increases in Poland through October as supply from Lotos’ Gdansk refinery was expected to be reduced.

Domestic prices in Poland were indicated as high as €385/t ex-works, rising sharply by €15-20/t, while Polish bitumen truck exports to Germany were assessed up €5/t at €345-355/t ex-works.

Czech exports to Germany were also assessed up €5/t at €345-355/t ex-works, while Czech domestic prices were assessed €15/t firmer at €375-385/t ex-works amid limited availability of some supplies from PKN Orlen subsidiary Unipetrol’s Litvinov refinery, notably of pen 160/220.

Polish truck exports to Ukraine were indicated at around €360/t ex-works, with some offers from Germany into Poland indicated at around €350-360/t ex-works.

Country gear up for the expected rise in demand following the release of some funds to constructors, with a ramp up in demand expected by the end of October to last through until year end depending on weather conditions in the country.

Vitol's local arm completed an expansion to around 7,000t capacity — from its previous 4,000t — at its Galati import terminal.

Hungarian domestic truck prices were assessed unchanged at €380-390/t ex-works, while Hungarian exports to Romania were assessed unchanged at €390-400/t ex-works Szazhalombatta. Some exports from Mol’s Szazhalombatta refinery were indicated as low as €340-345/t ex-works into the Polish market.

Rompetrol's Vega refinery in Ploiesti, Romania, was expected to ramp up bitumen production following the restart of the Midia refinery at Navodari around 20 September. The restart will lead to the resumption of feedstock flows to Ploiesti. The 4,999 dwt Sunpower loaded a cargo from Aspropyrgos, Greece, for discharge into Mangalia on Romania’s Black Sea coast.

# Hungary/Romania/Balkans

Regional domestic and export prices were assessed unchanged, but market participants expected a steady rise in demand as well as a hike in some prices, including in Romania, related to crude and fuel oil gains through the rest of the month.

Romanian domestic were still assessed at €410-420/t ex-works, while imports from Poland, which market participants said were uncompetitive with local Romanian supplies, were also unchanged at €350-360/t ex-works. More bitumen truck loads were sold by a Greek firm to a Romanian importer in the week ending 1 October as importers in the country.

# Demand in Latvia

Demand in Latvia was strong with constructors working on projects in the run up to winter, with bitumen consumption at healthy levels in the country, according to market participants, while Lithuanian demand was also steady with a good rate of bitumen demand.

In Finland however, demand was slowly unwinding with the onset of snowfall in the north of the country, with importers looking to future supplies for storage over the winter.

# Fob Baltic Cargo Premiums

Fob Baltic cargo premiums to fob Rotterdam HSFO barges were assessed $2-3/t down at around $20/t to reflect signs of a slowdown in regional cargo demand.

# Hungary and Romania Domestic Prices

|Country|Domestic Prices (€ / t)|
|---|---|
|Hungary|500|
|Romania|410-420|

# Posted Prices from Orlen's Mazeikiai Refinery

Posted prices from Orlen's Mazeikiai refinery were up €10/t, with pen 50/70 and 70/100 at €3980/t ex-works and pen 100/150 and 160/220 at €405/t ex-works.

# Shipping Updates

The 4,999 dwt Seapower loaded a cargo from St Petersburg for discharge into Tallinn on 1 October, while the 6,065 dwt Acacia Rubra moved a cargo from Lomonosov to Pori, arriving 30 September. The 4,972 dwt Bitonia, its name changed from the Alcedo that was delivered to Sweden-based TSA Tanker Shipping in June after the firm purchased it, moved a cargo from Hamburg to Akureyi, Iceland.

# Mediterranean Market Commentary

# Summary

Mediterranean bitumen cargo prices ended September with sharp gains as high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) prices rose substantially, while bitumen cargo premiums stabilised after declining for much of the month.

Spanish export premiums to HSFO were assessed unchanged at $20-25/t fob, Greek fob cargo premiums were assessed unchanged at $15-20/t, with most Turkish export flows indicated in the same range, while Italian fob cargo premiums were also assessed unchanged at $15-20/t. The impact of a lack of westbound transatlantic arbitrage opportunities, as well as a general demand slowdown within the Mediterranean basin was leading to greater availabilities across the region.

Delivered values into key north African markets were falling, with some delivered premium offers in the low $50’s/t into Algerian terminals in October, although most indications into Algeria and Morocco were still in the high $50s/t, while delivered Egyptian values for end-October were also in the same high $50s/t to HSFO delivered area.

The gains in Mediterranean outright values made it yet more unprofitable to move spot arbitrage cargoes to the US east, with Spanish fob levels surging to around $460/t fob during the last week of September, higher than cif US east coast cargoes that were trading around $450/t.

Egyptian state-refiner EGPC awarded a further 5,000-6,000t cargo to trading firm BGN at a $57/t delivered premium, basis Alexandria, for end-October delivery, additional to the firm's original four-cargo tender awarded to Puma Energy and 3B Trading.

The market enters its usual fourth quarter slowdown period, that a number of tankers are to become open for spot business from around 5 October onwards. While vessel waiting and discharge lengthy delays at Alexandria, Egypt, mean some tankers are being occupied for longer periods, with Ukraine port delays anyway a feature of the shipping market this year, the bearish Mediterranean shipping picture is expected to cause mounting downward pressures on rates for standard 5,000t movements.

The Augusta-Mohammedia route was assessed $2-3/t down at $44-47/t, with Augusta-Alexandria and Greece-Alexandria routes also assessed $2-3/t weaker at $41-44/t and $35-37/t respectively. On the region's shorter routes, $1-2/t assessed declines took values to $31-33/t for Tarragona-Mohammedia, $24-26/t for Augusta-Tunisia, $28-30/t for Livorno-Tunisia, $25-27/t for Tarragona-Ghazaouet and $29-31/t on Greek ports to Gebze/Mersin, Turkey.

# Algeria/Morocco

Delivered cargo values into north African markets were falling with indications from market participants for October delivered cargoes ranging from the low to the high $50s/t into Algeria and Morocco.

Market participants estimated Algerian bitumen consumption to have been around 65,000t in September, while they expected a slight increase in bitumen demand for October to 70,000t, as constructors were able to resume work on a greater number of projects after the release of some funds after a period over the past two months when such government disbursements had been well below market expectations. Local suppliers are now looking ahead to what they expect to be a fairly busy fourth quarter.

Output from Sonatrach’s Arzew refinery was around 400t/day, while some bitutainer volumes were sent from Arzew to Nouakchott, Mauritania, as well as by truck from southern Algerian depots to Niger. The firm is expected to substantially boost its overall bitutainer fleet to around 100 by the end of October to enable it to expand its regional export business.

Several cargoes were heading into Algerian ports after a slowdown in the rate of imports in September. The 6,180 dwt Iver Balance loaded a cargo from Cadiz, Spain, for discharge into Oran on 30 September, while the 8,021 dwt Poestella loaded a cargo from Augusta, Sicily, for discharge into Algiers by 2 October.

The 5,895 dwt The Deputy loaded a cargo from Cadiz, Spain, for discharge into Mohammedia by 28 October, while a cargo was expected to be loaded at Port-Jerome, northern France, in the first 10 days of October for delivery into Djen Djen.

# egypt

Egyptian state-owned EGPC awarded an additional cargo to its original four-cargo award, with the fifth 5,000-6,000t cargo awarded to trading firm BGN at a $57/t delivered premium to fob Mediterranean HSFO cargoes, basis Alexandria. The original tender for four 5,000-6,000t cargoes of pen 60/70 bitumen for mid to late October delivery into its Alexandria terminal saw two cargoes each awarded to Puma Energy and BB Energy unit 3B Trading, at values between $57-58/t to HSFO delivered premiums.

The 5,765 dwt Iver Agile loaded a cargo from Mersin, Turkey, for 2 October delivery into Alexandria where lengthy discharge delays have emerged over the past few weeks.

# Spain

Spanish fob cargo premiums to fob Mediterranean HSFO cargoes were assessed unchanged at $20-25/t, while outright values were up sharply.

Demand for US east coast cargoes remained weak going into October with cif US east coast values steady around $450/t from US east, lower than fob Spain outright price indications of around $460/t in late-September, keeping the westbound arbitrage unprofitable.

# Mediterranean Market Commentary

Spanish domestic demand remained steady with domestic truck prices assessed unchanged at €455-465/t ex-works on 1 October with no confirmation yet from sellers or buyers of finalised monthly prices for October volumes.

The 6,586 dwt Iver Bitumen loaded a cargo from Huelva for discharge into Tenerife, Canary Islands, arriving 1 October, while the 7,066 dwt Herbania loaded a cargo from Huelva for discharge into Ghazaouet, Algeria, on 29 September.

The 6,118 dwt Ning Hai Wan loaded a cargo from Huelva for discharge into Donges, France, on 29 September.

# Italy

Fob cargo premiums to Mediterranean HSFO prices from Italian export terminals were assessed unchanged at $15-20/t with greater availability being indicated by some market participants as regional demand begins to slow down.

Italian domestic demand remained buoyant, but prices were unchanged going into October, with market participants anticipating activity and demand to remain steady at strong levels during much of the fourth quarter.

Strong gains in fuel oil and crude values have been the main driver of upward revisions of domestic Italian values, with some market participants anticipating renewed bitumen truck price hikes during October as refiners aim to keep pace with rising crude oil prices.

Domestic truck prices were assessed unchanged in the week ending 1 October at €390-400/t ex-works, including the €31/t domestic duty on sales of road paving penetration grades, while truck export prices into southern France as well as Switzerland were indicated around €365-375/t ex-works.

The 6,165 dwt An Hai Wan loaded a cargo from Tarragona, Spain, for discharge into Naples, while the 5,897 dwt Iver Action loaded a cargo from Augusta for discharge into the southern French port of Lavera by 2 October.

# Greece

Greek export cargo premiums to fob Mediterranean HSFO cargoes were assessed unchanged at $15-20/t fob, with market participants indicating offers within that range for prompt loadings.

Demand for Greek loading spot cargoes was however thin amid a general downturn in Mediterranean demand heading into the fourth quarter, while refiners were highly reluctant to allow their spot cargoes to be sold at markedly lower values than those agreed under their annual contractual deals for 2021 supplies.

Domestic Greek truck prices gained significant ground, rising €24/t, with ex-works offers from Hellenic Petroleum's Aspropyrgos and Thessaloniki refineries at €424/t and €426/t ex-works respectively, while truck sales from Motor Oil Hellas' Agio Theodori refinery were indicated at €424/t ex-works.

Trucks continued to be sent into the Romanian market, with a Greek firm sending a further 30 trucks into the country from its storage tanks at Thessaloniki in anticipation of pick up in Romania activity and demand by the end of October as money begins to reach more constructors in a rush to complete road projects before winter.

The 4,999 dwt Sunpower loaded a cargo from Aspropyrgos for discharge into Mangalia on Romania’s Black Sea coast. The 37,000 dwt Asphalt Synergy loaded a cargo on 22 September from Agio Theodori and was located near Gibraltar on 1 October, with no end destination as yet clear for its cargo. The 6,065 dwt Fuji Lava was loading a cargo from Aspropyrgos on 30 September, having previously discharged a cargo into Nikolaev, Ukraine.

# Turkey

Domestic prices in Turkey continued their recent run of strength with posted prices at Tupras' refineries surging TL313-314/t to TL4,718/t ex-works Izmit and Izmir refineries and to TL4,762/t ex-works Batman and Kirikkale refineries, with those values effective from 28 September.

The rise in prices is in part a result of higher crude values and a weakening Turkish Lira, but market participants also noted a slowdown in imports from Iraqi Kurdistan and other Iraqi export points, with production lower in part linked to rising vacuum residue feedstock costs and specification issues on some bitumen grades.

Domestic Turkish demand was also picking up pace in a final rush to complete works by constructors before the usual winter halt in activity from December.

A second cargo from the Mideast Gulf is expected in the coming weeks into the Toros Gubre terminal at Ceyhan, with as yet no clear indication of which tanker is to make that journey or any firm shipment dates.

# West Africa

Cargo prices for delivery into regional import terminals surged as a renewed spike in crude and high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) prices drove up outright bitumen values.

Spanish and Ivory Coast cargo premiums to fob Mediterranean HSFO cargoes were assessed unchanged at $20-25/t and around $115/t fob respectively after recent declines and amid marked reluctance amongst major European refinery suppliers to export product at yet lower premiums than under their existing contractual arrangements for 2021 sales.

Freight rate assessments for standard 5,000t spot cargo movements from Spanish to Nigerian ports stayed in the $150-160/t range, but mounting downward pressures on cross-Mediterranean rates could exert similar pressure on west Africa-bound and intra-regional freight rates over the coming weeks.

West African construction activity and bitumen demand levels remained subdued as rainy season conditions saw no sign of letting up. The greatest concentration of rainfall affecting the southern and western parts of the region, principally Nigeria, Cameroon, Ivory Coast and Ghana.

The 45,974 dwt Bitu Express arrived at the 36,000t capacity Rubis deep-water terminal at Lome, Togo, on 26 September with a large cargo loaded at the Agio Theodori terminal in Greece. The volume helped bolster regional stocks in readiness for the end of the rainy season and the resumption of dry season road project requirements, expected in Nigeria to begin from the end of October.

The final destination of the tanker's sister ship — the 45,986 dwt Bitu Atlantic — was so far undisclosed after it loaded at the Tarragona export terminal in Spain and headed west to pass Gibraltar on 1 October. The destination could be either the US or west Africa.

The 9,776 dwt Viveka returned to the Lome terminal after making a two-port shipment from the Togolese location into Cape Town and Durban, South Africa.

# mauritania/mali/Niger

International container shipping rates showed no sign of easing after recent hefty gains, but Algerian firm Naftal, Sonatrach's marketing and supply unit, was at end of September loading a second 300t bitutainer consignment at its Arzew bitumen plant and terminal for shipment to Nouakchott, Mauritania.

The Algerian firm had in July won a tender to supply 10,000t of bitumen to Mauritania, as well as another 3,000t to Mali. While security fears in Mali mean no near term prospects.

# Market Commentary

Pect of any deliveries into that market, Naftal had sent its first 300t bitutainer volume to Nouakchott for the Mauritanian market in late-August, also from Arzew. Naftal, which is in the process of expanding its fleet of bitutainers built by an Algerian firm, has also been supplying small-scale bitutainer volumes into Niger from its depots in southern Algeria.

# Nigeria

Nigerian bitumen stocks remained at high levels after a number of cargo deliveries into its terminals during September at a time of weak demand amid continued and intensive rainy season conditions.

The latest data released by the country's Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) showed stocks of the product stood on 30 September at 31,106,384 litres (31,707t), down slightly from a peak of 31,906,036 litres (32,523t) on 22 September but still 26pc up from the 1 September level of 24,729,625 litres (25,208t).

The 5,076 dwt Jane Asphalt arrived at the Abidjan terminal in Ivory Coast to load its next cargo for delivery into Gradient Energy's Warri terminal in Nigeria's Delta State. All previous cargo shipments on board the tanker into the Gradient terminal during 2021 have been made from Spanish export terminals at Huelva, Tarragona and Cadiz, as well as one February cargo movement from Augusta, Sicily.

The 11,406 dwt Biskra was still located off Port Harcourt on 29 September, having arrived there on 23 September with the second of its two-port discharges, the first having been into Sapele.

# Ghana/Ivory Coast/Cameroon

The prospect of an alternative Ghanaian bulk bitumen importer was pushed back by a few months as local firm GOIL delayed its 6,000t bitumen terminal project in the Tema port area.

The $35mn project in a joint venture with Ivory Coast bitumen producer SMB, also includes a 30t/hour capacity styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) polymer-modified bitumen (PMB) plant as well as a 60t/hr emulsions unit. The project had been slated for end-September completion, but is now being targeted to be ready at the end of this year (see news).

Virtually all of Ghana's bulk cargo imports are currently made into its Takoradi terminal, mainly from SMB's Abidjan refinery and terminal complex, with Shell and Total receiving those volumes of AC-10 and AC-20 and selling them to local truck buyers.

The 4,900 dwt SMB time-chartered San Biagio moved a cargo from the firm's Abidjan refinery and terminal complex to Douala, Cameroon, arriving there on 29 September. Armed guards on board was indicated by vessel tracking services, underlining the continued security risks associated with shipping movements in the Gulf of Guinea.

# East Africa

Regional import prices for both drummed and bulk bitumen imports from the Mideast Gulf maintained their upward momentum amid gains in both fob and delivered prices.

The sharpest gains affected the Iranian drummed export trade to east African ports, with Iranian exports assessed $16/t up at $365-380/t fob Bandar Abbas, while freight rates from Bandar Abbas to Mombasa, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, were assessed $10/t up at $95-100/t amid relentless gains in container shipping costs caused by global shortage in that sector.

Market participants reported price indications into Kenya at values anywhere from $460/t up to the $475-485/t cfr Mombasa range for direct shipments from Bandar Abbas and as high as $650-660/t for indirect flows via Jebel Ali.

Regional suppliers said Iranian state-owned IRISL and its HDS affiliate had raised direct shipping rates from Bandar Abbas to Mombasa and Dar es Salaam to $1,850-1,950 per container ($90-100/t), while some east Africa bound movements made indirectly by international container shipping lines were indicated as high as $5,000 per container ($250/t).

Market participants named several such lines that were offering little or no services on Mideast Gulf to east and other sub-Saharan Africa routes.

Assessed freight rates from Bandar Abbas to Djibouti were also $10/t firmer at $185-190/t given that the route can.

only be served by international shipping lines moving moves in directly via UAE ports, principally Jebel Ali.

Iranian bulk cargo exports were assessed $10-11/t up at $290-305/t fob Bandar Abbas, while Bahraini state-owned refiner Bapco announced it would raise its listed cargo export price by $15/t to $440/t fob Sitra with effect from 2 October in the wake of two sets of hikes over the past month.

# Southern Africa

South African domestic and truck export prices jumped, with some of the export flows now indicated at around Rand 8,300/t ($550-560/t) ex-works.

A steady stream of requirements was reported into Zambia, Malawi and Botswana, with drummed flows also heading into Zimbabwe from neighbouring South Africa.

# kenya/Uganda/South Sudan

Regional suppliers pointed to more busy rates of construction activity and bitumen requirements in Kenya, Uganda and South Sudan.

While supply of Iranian drummed bitumen remains tight amid container shipping and container shortages as well as regular delays in such shipping movements, especially on Iranian state-owned IRISL vessels, bulk cargo supply movements have helped to alleviate some of the availability issues in east African markets.

The 3,764 dwt R Ocean was set to deliver its bulk cargo into the Skytrade Global terminal in Mombasa after its scheduled 10 October arrival with its cargo loaded in the Mideast Gulf, following the previous 30 August delivery on the same tanker. While nearly all the volumes in the previous shipment have already been delivered to local and regional buyers, around half of the new shipment's volume was understood to have already been pre-sold by the week ending 1 October.

Domestic drummed and bulk truck prices were expected to face upward pressure because of the spike in delivered values into Mombasa, Kenya. Bulk truck volumes were indicated at Kenyan Shillings 71-73/kg ($642-660/t) ex-works Mombasa, while drummed sales were at KES73-74/kg ($660-669/t) and expected to rise in early October to as high as KES75/kg ($679/t).

# South Africa

Domestic truck prices shot up as South African refiners dramatically raised their prices to reflect large gains in crude and other feedstock costs during September as well as a weakening Rand against the US dollar.

Gains of R700-800/t from some suppliers were reported by market participants to have already taken effect from 1 October, with assessments rising R750/t to the R9,200-9,600/t ex-works range.

Rates of construction activity have been rising during the current peak season period that began on 1 September, with buoyant rates of project work reported in KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape provinces. Some of that work is connected with construction of the multi-billion Rand Msikaba and Mtentu bridges that will form part of the N2 Wild Coast mega road project. Funding allocations for the next round of South African National Roads Authority (Sanral) backed projects was awaited, with those projects most likely to start sometime in 2022.

# Singapore

Asia bitumen prices, 25 Sep-1 Oct

Singapore bitumen prices edged up another $5/t this week, supported by stronger deals and discussions among local sellers and regional buyers.

On a fob Singapore basis, a key trader sold about 15,000t in total to Indonesian buyers at $410/t for November-loading. Several deals for October loading were also concluded at about $405-410/t levels. Two more deals to be loaded in end-October were also concluded into Vietnam on a cfr basis, with fob values at $405-410/t.

Offers from refiners and local traders ranged at $415-425/t for late-October/early-November loading cargoes that met bids or buying indications in the $405-410/t range.

Supply from Singapore is expected to be more balanced in October on the back of production loss from 2-3 key refiners. The persistent negative spread between bitumen and high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) could be pushing refiners to incentivise production of HSFO versus bitumen.

Tank truck prices from Singapore have continued to rise and were at $406-415/t ex-refinery. Demand in Malaysia has been slowing again from the central region of Peninsular Malaysia, following the recent pick-up.

Prices of tank trucks from Singapore jumped to around $415-430/t ex-refinery. Regional players have also noted that tighter bitumen supply across Singapore and Malaysia has resulted in higher prices for tank trucks. An offer into Johore was at around 1920 ringgit/t ($456/t) on a delivered basis.

Domestic prices in Singapore were raised by $20.50/t to $420-445/t ex-tank for October on the back of higher crude values in the past month. Domestic demand is expected to however remain flat against September, with manpower limitations and expected wet weather to hamper works.

# Malaysia

Bitumen demand in Malaysia was stable-to-firm as most construction projects across the country continued to operate at a steady pace. Demand from the Klang Valley continued to occupy a large share of total volumes lifted, with bitumen demand from ongoing projects and premix plants remaining firm over the past three weeks. The state-owned refiner increased its tank truck prices to around 1,830-1,880 ringgit/t ex-Malacca ($437-449/t). Prices from Port Klang rose similarly to around 1,870-1,900/t ex-Klang ($447-454/t). Delivered prices in the north have also edged up to around 1,870-1960 ringgit/t ($447-466/t) in response to an increase in listed prices from the state-owned refiner’s Prai facility. Several players have expressed that erratic rainfall over several construction sites has affected the progress of projects, but demand across Peninsula Malaysia in the coming months is expected to remain firm as most construction projects continue to edge towards completion by end November.

Prices on a fob basis were assessed at $395-405/t in line with the trend seen in Singapore.

A deal for a 2,000-3,000t cargo bound for central Vietnam, with a laycan period set in the first week of November, was at around $395-400/t fob.

Regional traders have noted firmer buying indications from Vietnamese buyers for end October and first half November-loading cargoes. Demand from Vietnam is expected to pick up in November, as the seasonal monsoon ends.

Domestic demand for bitumen was mostly muted. Floods across several regions in Thailand after tropical storm Dianmu has hit operations in multiple construction sites in Bangkok and other parts of central Thailand.

Domestic prices rose to around $490-550/t ex-refinery in response to higher crude prices. The higher cost of production has necessitated an increase in its listed prices.

# indonesia

Bitumen demand in Indonesia continued to strengthen as the country approached its annual peak season for the bitumen market. Demand from the islands of Sumatra, Kalimantan and Sulawesi continued to be relatively firm on the back of ongoing projects.

A deal for a 1,500t Singapore origin cargo bound for Kalimantan with a loading period set in first half October was at above $430/t cfr Kalimantan. A 3,000t 1H October loading cargo bound for North Sulawesi was concluded at around $440/t cfr. Another deal for a 3,000t lot for first half October loading to South Sumatra was concluded at around $440/t cfr. A deal by a Singapore-based trader totalling up to 15,000t to be loaded across November and first half December was also done this week.

Buying ideas were in the $395-410/t fob range for end October and early November loading cargoes. Most regional players have continued to indicate their preference for delivered cargoes:

# Vietnam

More deals and discussions surfaced in Vietnam as demand firmed with the easing of lockdown. Some roadworks were also hampered this week by the ongoing wet weather.

An importer concluded two October loading cargoes from north Asia at $440-445/t cfr, with one small volume loading for south Vietnam from Thailand and another 5,000t cargo to north Vietnam.

Two 3,000t cargoes from Singapore were concluded at $440/t cfr south Vietnam and $455/t cfr north Vietnam. This could not be confirmed with the buyer. Freight costs were estimated at $30-35/t to south Vietnam and $45-50/t to north Vietnam.

An offer for an end-October loading cargo at $440/t cfr was seen from a Singapore-based refiner, with the volume and discharge ports yet to be fixed. The cargo was understood to be part of a larger shipment heading towards the north in end-October. Other offers into Vietnam for second-half October volumes were ranging between $445-455/t cfr for cargoes of both southeast Asian and northeast Asia origins, with most buying ideas at $440-445/t cfr. Discussions for November volumes had yet to commence.

On a fob South Korea basis, no sell tenders were awarded. But a key refiner is expected to open a sell tender for its November loading cargoes in the coming weeks. Demand from China remains weak and is anticipated to remain a bearish factor for the Korean sellers.

Meanwhile, some key refineries are continuing to produce less bitumen on the back of strong HSFO economics. The reduced physical volumes of bitumen has helped to balance the overall supply availability for October.

Domestic prices in South Korea were raised by $51/t for October, as recent firmness in crude values lent to higher domestic selling prices. Demand outlook for October remains slightly mixed, with local players wary of the recent spike in Covid-19 cases following the Thanksgiving festival holiday recently.

In Japan, domestic prices were raised by ¥1,000/t to ¥63,513-71,619/t ex-tank. Demand in September has been mostly stable against the previous month. More roadworks are expected to commence in October, though some projects might slow down with the upcoming general elections in November. Some sellers were anticipating slightly tighter supply in October, with one refiner’s terminal in Yokohama undergoing maintenance. This could not be confirmed.

# Taiwan

In line with regional price movements, export prices from Taiwan were assessed $2.50/t higher to $400-405/t fob Taiwan.

Volumes from the private refiner remain limited, with no indications given on production levels for November and December.

Reduced volumes have also prompted buyers to seek alternative cargoes of other origins.

Domestic prices from the state-owned refiner were unchanged at NT17,000/t ex-tank.

# China

Limited negotiations were seen in China with the country heading into the week-long break for Golden Week celebrations from 1-7 October.

A key state-owned refiner raised its domestic listed prices by 20-70 yuan/t for key refineries in east China and by 50 yuan/t for refineries in the south. The upward revisions were seen as mostly in line with the firmness in global crude prices, with domestic demand expected to improve post-Golden Week. Another smaller state-owned refiner also raised listed prices by 230 yuan/t at its terminal in the southwest.

Ongoing power shortages in parts of China had limited impact on production. Some refineries in areas affected by power shortages may have slowed the rate of production, but supply levels were mostly unaffected.

A state-owned refinery in Shandong also resumed operations on 25 September after a planned turnaround. Two refineries in the east and in the south are due to undergo a month-long maintenance from October. Overall supply levels are expected to remain ample with the refiner planning to raise overall bitumen production by about 50,000-100,000t in October. The planned increment comes on the back of reduced petroleum coke production which has been curtailed due to carbon emission reduction plans.

Few discussions for imported cargoes were seen with

Most buyers preferring to delay negotiations until after 8 October. In east China, an offer for an October-loading South Korean cargo was at 3,250 yuan/t. About 7,000t of October-loading cargo from South Korea were also concluded at 3,300-3,350 yuan/t to east China. This could not be confirmed. Another importer concluded a very prompt 5,000 South Korean cargo which loaded this week at $424/t cfr east China.

In south China, no firm discussions for imports were seen amid scant buying interest. An offer for November and December-loading cargoes from a Singapore-based refiner was made at $460/t cfr south China.

Higher freight rates were quoted for cargoes from South Korea to east China, with ship owners having to contend with higher demurrage fees due to ongoing port congestion, particularly along the Yangtze River. Freight rates were at $38-45/t for 5,000t cargoes, though few to no buyers were willing to take the higher offers.

# Australia & New Zealand

In the state of Victoria, the ongoing construction sector shutdown in Melbourne and other areas will be lifted from 5 October, with stringent Covid-19 measures in place. One seller estimated a reduction of around 50pc of sales this week due to the shutdown, with some slowdown also attributed to the wet weather. Overall demand is expected to pick up gradually in October and firm further in November.

Discussions were ongoing for November-loading cargoes, with indicative offers at higher than current fob Singapore levels. One importer also concluded a 7,000t cargo from southeast Asia for loading mid-November on a formula basis.

In New Zealand, demand from Auckland is expected to reach similar levels to the rest of the country gradually, with roadworks picking up despite the city remaining under the stricter “level 3” Covid-19 measures. Ullage levels remain manageable with importers citing no need to delay or divert incoming cargoes.

# India

In the Indian market, demand is slowly returning as the monsoon is nearing its end. Roadworks are picking up slowly in parts of the country with the monsoon expected to end in another 10 days time.

Buying of bulk and drummed parcels from Iran picked up this week but port inventories remain on the high side, thus deterring a firm upturn. Local refiners also raised prices for bulk by 1,600 Indian rupees/t and for drummed cargoes by 2,600 Indian rupees/t from 1 October.

# Bahrain

Bahrain’s state-owned refiner will be increasing its bitumen listed prices by $15/t with effect from 2 October on the back of the recent hikes in crude and fuel oil prices. This price hike will see listed prices increase to $440/t fob Sitra.

This is the third time in a month where the refiner has announced a price increase.

# Iran

The Iranian market firmed supported by higher VB feed prices and improved demand. The exchange rate fluctuated in the 233,000-273,000 rials range on the local platforms. Bulk prices were assessed at $290-305/t fob Bandar Abbas. Bulk cargoes from Bandar Imam Khomeini port were offered at $285-290/t fob.

A 5,000t VG40 bulk lot was sold at $292/t fob Bandar Abbas to India for prompt delivery. A 4,000t bulk cargo was sold at $287/t to India. A 6,000t vessel size cargo was sold at $290/t to India for prompt delivery. A total 9,000t of bulk cargoes were loaded based on previous contracts at $285/t fob.

Demand remained firm for bulk to Pakistan with at least 10,000t sold at 81,000-82,000 rials/kg (about $300/t) ex-Esfahan, up 3,000 rials/kg week-on-week. Demand from Afghanistan remained subdued.

Demand for drums was boosted in the past week and prices were assessed at $365-375/t on different payment terms. Buying interest for drums from India increased as.

demand is slowly firming, amid thin supply of Iraqi drums. A producer sold 10,000t in drums at $365-367/t to Sri Lanka and India. A total 10,000t of pen 60/70 in drums traded at $365-367/t to Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and India on cash payment basis.

Total 2,000t were sold at $375/t for October laycan to east Africa. A 5,000t Jey-embossed cargo sold at $373-376/t fob, while several small cargoes were sold at $365-370/t to Tanzania, Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh and the UAE. A total 5,000t in drums sold at $415-420/t cfr Turkmenistan for prompt delivery, with freight and logistic charges estimated at $65/t.

Private shipping companies imposed a new General Rate Increase (GRI) for transshipment cargoes from Jebel Ali at an average $100/container ($5/t) from 26 September. In addition to this, direct shipments from Iran to Kenya rose from $1,550/container to $1,850/container from this week, while no container was available by IRISL for exporters.

Jumbo bag prices remained stable at $350-360/t, but demand was thin due to the low gap with drum cargoes. Iraqi bitumen supply has weakened over the past month and a major producer was offered drum cargoes at $355-360/t, while a 10,000t drum cargo was sold at $335-340/t early this week to Myanmar and India. Market players said Iraqi vacuum residue (VR) feed price rose sharply and availability of VR in north Iraq fell sharply and several bitumen producers in Kurdistan region has halted production.

On the IME, prices moved up as competition rose between buyers. Jey Oil sold 8,000t of pen 60/70 in bulk at 86,206 rials/kg ($316/t) ex-Bandar Abbas, up by $10/t. Jey Oil also sold 7,000t at 80,350 rials/kg ($294/t) ex-Esfahan, up around 3,900 rials/kg week-on-week and 10,000t in drums were sold at 93,009-97,666 rials/kg ($341-358/t) ex–Esfahan.

Pasargad Oil increased prices to around 4,050 rials/kg ($14/t) and sold 5,000t bulk on 81,700 rials/kg ($300/t) ex-Bandar Abbas. Another 2,000t in bulk was sold at 76,961 rials/kg ex-Arak refinery, while 10,000t bulk of pen 60/70 sold at 76,950 rials/kg ($283/t) ex-Abadan.

# Iran Local Market

VB feed prices continued on an upward trend as the Oil Refining Industry Association (Orica) revised VB feed prices on 25 September. VB feed prices from Bandar Abbas and Shiraz Refineries were announced at 75,244 rials/kg, up by 4,970 rials/kg ($18/t) and from other refineries at 71,661 rials/kg, up by 4,733 rials/kg ($17.5/t).

But buying interest was healthy due to lowered VB supply by refineries and expectations of further rise in prices in the coming revision, led by hikes in crude and HSFO prices. About 202,000t demand registered for VB feed, while 103,000t was sold by refineries on IME this week.

Bandar Abbas refinery announced a planned maintenance for a month from mid-October. VB feed supply from Bandar Abbas refinery is likely to drop by 50pc from this week until the end of November. Bandar Abbas Refinery offered 20,000t of VB feed at 75,244 rials/kg and 71,000t demand was registered. They finally sold 20,000t at an average of 78,919 rials/kg.

Tehran Refinery may also undergo maintenance from mid-October and likely will reduce VB feed supply too. Tehran Refinery sold 20,000t of VB feed at 75,421 rial/kg, up by 4,000 rials/kg ($14.50/t). Esfahan Refinery sold 10,000t at 75,004 rials/kg, up by 4,000 rials/kg ($14.50/t). Tabriz Refinery sold 8,000t at 71,616 rials/kg, up by 3,100 rials/kg. Abadan Refinery sold 20,000t at 71,661-74,999 rials/kg. Arak Refinery sold 25,000t at 74,570 rials/kg, up by about 6,000 rials/kg. Shiraz Refinery sold 10,000t at 75,244 rials/kg, up by about 3,000 rials/kg.

Bitumen prices rose in the domestic market, following a surge in VB feed prices and producers sold 4,308t of different products at 74,000-110,000 rials/kg on IME.

# Narrow margins pressure Iran's bitumen

Iranian bitumen production fell by an estimated 22pc during March-August, faced by the double whammy of higher costs of production and weak demand from key markets.

Iran's VB feed sales volume fell by about 22pc from 2.962mn t to 2.314mn t between 22 March and 22 August 2021 compared with the same period last year. As a result, bitumen production also fell by at least about 22pc during the same period.

Meanwhile, bitumen sellers have seen weak demand in domestic as well as regional markets. Producers have also seen an increasing squeeze on margins on the rising cost of VB feed prices. This, coupled with stronger high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) economics, has resulted in higher production of fuel oil and has reduced export volumes.

“We reduced trading activities for bitumen as there is no profit margin, and have switched to other products,” said several local traders.

“As a producer, we have faced losses over the past months and were forced to sell our cargoes only to pay our debts from purchasing VB feed that was bought earlier,” said several producers.

As a result, the number of companies trading or selling bitumen within Iran has fallen over the past few months.

A gap was seen in buy-sell expectations as higher offers based on higher costs of production were rejected by buyers from key markets. This was further underpinned by the impact of Covid-19, which resulted in issues with government funds and slowed paving activities in recent months.

“We purchased VB feed at 70,274 rials/kg [$285/t] and produced bitumen at $315/t fob, including storage and VAT costs, but we have sold without any profit,” said industry participants. The government did not give a tax rebate to many exporters in the past two years and imposed a bitumen export tax from March 2021 onwards.

VB feed supply fell by 21pc from 3.24mn t to 2.56mn t between 22 March and 22 August this year. This was supported by a possible move by Iranian refineries to increase fuel oil production because of higher demand, in contrast to weak demand from bitumen producers.

On the other hand, Iran's bitumen exports in August slid by 32pc compared with a month earlier and was 48pc lower year-on-year amid low demand from Asian markets. Exports fell to about 221,730t in August, down from 326,000t sold in July. Meanwhile Iran’s export sales stood at 431,000t in August 2020, according to data from the Iran Mercantile Exchange.

# Vietnam’s bitumen demand to rise

Bitumen demand from Vietnam looks set to increase in the next few years, supported by an ambitious road development plan that seeks to construct over 5,000km of expressways between 2021-2030.

The Road Network Development Plan which was unveiled this month seeks to develop over 5,000km of expressways in the country by 2030, up from 3,841km in 2021.

Key areas for expressway development include extensions to the ongoing North-South Expressway project, as well as the 14 expressways in the north, which alone would total about 2,305km. It also includes 10 expressways making up around 1,431km in the central and central highlands region, and another 10 expressways totalling around 1,290km in the south.

On top of the new additions to the expressways, there are also plans for 172 national highway routes totalling

29,795km by 2030, and 3,034km of coastal roads spanning 28 cities and provinces. The road development plan is one of the five master blueprints for the country’s transport sector, which include plans for high-speed rail routes, sea ports and new international airports to be constructed between this year and 2030. The investment capital for the plan is estimated to be about 900,000bn dong ($39.6bn), according to a draft issued by Vietnam’s Ministry of Transport. The bulk of the project funding is expected to come from public-private partnership (PPP) investment.

The Vietnamese government had in January this year unveiled a new PPP framework to support the country’s development plans, where investors of projects in transportation, healthcare, education, power transmission and water sectors can receive benefits such as tax reductions or credit support, among others.

Vietnam does not produce bitumen, which is used in road construction. The country imported close to 890,000t of bitumen in 2020, the highest in the last five years. New road construction projects are expected to continue as the government pushes for infrastructure development in tandem with economic goals, and has positioned Vietnam as an attractive business hub.

The road development plan is also aligned with Vietnam’s 11th Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP), which covers the period of 2021-2025 and includes the goal of achieving an average Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 6.5-7pc in the next five years.

# Ghana's new bitumen terminal delayed

Ghanaian state-owned oil and gas marketing firm Goil has pushed back the completion date for a new $35mn bitumen terminal and conversion project at the port of Tema to the end of this year. The 6,000t terminal — which will supply imported AC-10 and AC-20 bitumen performance grades to newly built polymer-modified bitumen (PMB) and bitumen emulsions plants — had been slated for completion by the end of this month. Covid-related issues are understood to be partly responsible for the delay.

Goil's joint venture partner in the project is Ivory Coast bitumen producer and exporter SMB, which has 300,000 t/yr of bitumen production capacity at its Abidjan refinery. The project was announced in 2017 and construction work began two years later. It is now 94pc complete.

Once operations start, bitumen imports into Tema will be fed to the terminal by a 3km pipeline, which will be electrically heated to keep the road paving product liquid before it is discharged into Goil's newly built storage tanks. The imported bitumen will then feed into the styrene-butadiene-styrene PMB plant, which will have the capacity to produce 30 t/hour. Some local market participants expect increased use of PMB in major road and highway projects in Ghana over the coming years.

One domestic construction sector player said its use had yet to be pursued aggressively by the country's highways authorities. The bitumen emulsions plant will have a capacity of 60 t/hr. Bitumen emulsions are already in much wider use in Ghana than PMB.

# Germany's Schwedt refinery completes restart

German refinery consortium PCK has completed the restart of its 208,000 b/d Schwedt refinery in north eastern Germany. The plant is ramping up production in order to reach a 80-100pc utilisation rate. Repair works on a high conversion soaker cracking (HSC) unit will last until mid-October, according to one of the refinery's shareholders. The PCK consortium comprises Russia's state-controlled Rosneft, Shell and Italian energy firm Eni. The facility was shut down by a regional electricity failure on 8 September. PCK began restart operations on the same day, but warned at the time that the process would take several days.

# Bahrain's Bapco raises bitumen prices by $15/t

Bahrain’s state-owned refiner Bapco will increase its bitumen listed prices by $15/t from 2 October on the back of higher crude and fuel oil prices. This price hike will see listed prices increase to $440/t fob Sitra. This is the third time in a month Bapco has announced a price increase. It raised listed prices by $20/t on two occasions, first on 11 September and again on 19 September. Hikes in high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) prices have prompted regional refiners to switch to producing HSFO over bitumen.

# Romania's Midia refinery back to 'optimal'

Repairs at Romania's 100,000 b/d Midia refinery, in Navodari on the Black Sea coast, have been largely completed, with operations scheduled to return to “optimal” levels by the end of October, Kazakh-owned operator Rompetrol Rafinare said. The refinery had been offline since early-July because of a fire, which killed three people and injured two others. Rompetrol Rafinare is performing the last technical checks to resume production and Midia's installations will be restarted in stages. The operator of the refinery said that it is currently in the phase of starting up petrol and diesel production units. Midia was previously expected to start on 20-24 September. The plant already supplied some raw material to Rompetrol Rafinare's Vega bitumen plant in Ploiesti last week, suggesting some units were operating, but the operator declined to say whether the restarting process began then. Midia's diesel hydrotreatment unit, where the fire broke out in July, has been “technologically isolated” and its repairs and restart is scheduled for 2022, the company said. The fire also affected the kerosene hydrotreater and catalytic reformer units, along with nearby pipes connected to the naphtha hydrotreater and saturated gases units, the company said last month.

# BTK’s bitumen terminal to be upgraded

Bunkering company Baltic Fuel (BTK) has secured Rbs1bn ($14mn) of financing for a two-phase project to increase bitumen loadings at its Turukhtannye Ostrova terminal at St Petersburg port. BTK subsidiary Kontur reached a six-year loan agreement with St Petersburg Bank for the project, which aims to add 43,800m³ of storage and increase loading capacity for bitumen and vacuum residue — a feedstock for bitumen production — as well as providing facilities to manufacture polymer-modified bitumen. Turukhtannye Ostrova has capacity to handle about 1.8mn t/yr of products, mainly fuel oil and gasoil, and more than 80,000m³ of tank-farm space — around
